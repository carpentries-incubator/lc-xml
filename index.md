**This lesson is not currently maintained. It was intended to be a lesson for librarians as part of the [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) lesson program but was not developed beyond initial lesson setup in 2019. In 2022, [the Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://carpentries.org/curriculum-advisors/) requested that the lesson be transferred to The Carpentries Incubator, in the hope that members of the community may find it and wish to take ownership of its development.** 

**If you would like to become a maintainer for this lesson and take charge of its development, please [open an issue on the lesson repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/lc-xml) and a member of The Carpentries team will help you get started.**
